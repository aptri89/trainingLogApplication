## Creating A Training Log Application for Triathletes


### What Does This Application Do?
This application helps triathletes (or any manner of endurance
athlete) to keep track of their workouts and training loads. It is able
to record several types of information that would be useful in analyzing
performance over time and allows an athlete to look back on their past
data. 

Some examples of the data this application can record (with some of the
most commonly used types in **bold**):
- **Average heart rate**
- **Pace** (for running and swimming workouts) (in seconds, either implied to be per 1km or 100m depending on
the workout title of running or swimming)
- **Average Speed** (for cycling workouts)
- Time (in minutes)
- Perceived Difficulty (on a scale of 1-10)
- Distance (in km)
- Training Load (minutes * perceived difficulty)

All of this data will be in an integer format. Each workout can also have a title and a date, both in 
string format. Each workout will be stored in a training log so that it can be viewed at a later date. 
I recommend you create a new list of workouts (training log) for each new week, titling them with the dates 
the list spans. 

### My Interest In This Project
I am a triathlete myself who has used multiple different platforms and software to record and track my training. 
Creating my own version of such an application is both an engaging and interesting opportunity to look at the 
thought process behind building something I use every day. 

### User Stories

- As a user, I want to be able to add new workouts to a training log (a list
of workouts).
- As a user, I want to be able to create a new training log and add a workout to it.
- As a user, I want to be able to select a workout and set my perceived difficulty. 
- As a user, I want to be able to select a workout and view my time spent exercising.
- As a user, I want to be able to select a training log and view the workouts in it. 
- As a user, I want to be able to see how many workouts with a certain title my training log contains.
  (ie. how many workouts titled "Running" are contained in my current training log)
